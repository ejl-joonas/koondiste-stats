## Planning Phase (2025-04-28 through 2025-05-19)

### Step 1: Data Understanding & Schema Design (1 week)
1. **Analyze Dartfish CSV Structure**
   - Examine column headers, data types, and formats
   - Identify timestamp formats and how events are recorded
   - Document any irregularities or special characters

2. **Map Data to Analysis Requirements**
   - Create mapping document connecting raw data fields to desired metrics
   - Identify any data gaps requiring additional calculation or inference
   - Note which fields correspond to your defined taxonomy (pressing zones, progression types, etc.)

3. **Define Output Schema**
   - Determine structure for storing processed results
   - Plan hierarchical organization (match level → period level → 5-minute intervals → events)
   - Design schema to support both team and individual player analysis

### Step 2: Core Architecture Planning (1 week)
1. **Module Structure**
   - Plan separation of concerns (data loading, processing, analysis, export)
   - Define interfaces between components
   - Establish error handling and logging strategy

2. **Data Processing Flow**
   - Design sequential pipeline for transforming raw data to insights
   - Plan for batch vs. streaming processing
   - Consider caching strategies for performance optimization

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Plan how to handle configurable parameters (zone definitions, momentum point values)
   - Design for easy updates to scoring models without code changes
   - Consider internationalization needs (Estonian/English terminology)

### Step 3: Algorithm Development Planning (1-2 weeks)
1. **Momentum Calculation Approach**
   - Plan implementation of your 5-minute interval momentum scoring system
   - Design methods to aggregate and normalize values
   - Consider visualization requirements when designing data structures

2. **Pressing Analysis Methods**
   - Design algorithms for classifying events into pressing zones
   - Plan for calculating pressing effectiveness metrics
   - Develop approach for transition moment identification

3. **Set-Piece & Progression Analysis**
   - Design algorithms for identifying and categorizing set-pieces
   - Plan approach for S1/S2/S3 progression classification
   - Develop methods for calculating efficiency metrics

### Step 4: Technical Requirements & Dependencies (3-4 days)
1. **Library Selection**
   - Identify required Python libraries:
     - pandas/numpy for data manipulation
     - matplotlib/seaborn/plotly for visualizations
     - scikit-learn for any advanced statistical analysis
   
2. **Environment Planning**
   - Determine Python version requirements
   - Plan dependency management approach (requirements.txt, poetry, etc.)
   - Consider containerization options for deployment

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Estimate dataset sizes and computational requirements
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Plan optimization strategies for large datasets

## Implementation Roadmap

   - Create flexible CSV parsers that handle Dartfish format variations
   - Implement data validation and cleaning functions
   - Develop error handling for corrupt or incomplete files

2. **Event Classification System**
   - Build classifiers for match events based on your taxonomy
   - Implement zone detection algorithms
   - Create functions to identify phases of play

3. **Basic Metric Calculation**
   - Implement foundational statistics calculation
   - Create aggregation functions for team-level metrics
   - Develop time-based windowing for period and interval analysis

### Step 6: Advanced Analytics Implementation

   - Implement the scoring system for match actions
   - Create momentum aggregation across time intervals
   - Develop momentum shift detection algorithms

2. **Individual Player Analysis**
   - Build position-specific rating calculators
   - Implement player contribution metrics
   - Create comparative analysis functions

3. **Expected Goals & Advanced Metrics**
   - Implement or integrate xG and xGOT calculations
   - Create expected threat models
   - Develop efficiency rating systems

### Step 7: Output Generation
1. **Data Export Module**
   - Create structured outputs for feeding to UI
   - Implement serialization for different formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
   - Build reporting templates for standard analyses

2. **Visualization Generation**
   - Develop functions to generate standard charts and visualizations
   - Implement heat map generation for spatial analysis
   - Create player rating visualizations

3. **API Layer**
   - Design clean API interfaces for UI integration
   - Implement caching for performance
   - Create documentation for all public functions

### Step 8: Testing & Validation
1. **Test Plan Development**
   - Create unit tests for core algorithms
   - Design integration tests for end-to-end validation
   - Develop specific test cases based on known match scenarios

2. **Validation Framework**
   - Create methods to validate outputs against expert interpretation
   - Implement sensitivity analysis for scoring parameters
   - Develop performance benchmarks

3. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive docstrings and API documentation
   - Develop maintenance guide for future developers
   - Create technical specifications document

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Plan for vectorized operations instead of loops where possible
   - Consider lazy evaluation for expensive calculations
   - Implement appropriate indexing for fast lookup

2. **Extensibility**
   - Design plugin architecture for new metrics
   - Create abstract base classes for core components
   - Use dependency injection for flexible configuration

3. **Error Handling & Logging**

4. **Integration Points**
   - Plan clear interfaces for Eyeball data integration
   - Design hooks for future data sources
   - Create well-defined API contracts for UI consumption
