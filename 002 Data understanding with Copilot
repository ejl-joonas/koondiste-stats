## Original Request

1. **Analyze Dartfish CSV Structure**
   - Examine column headers, data types, and formats
   - Identify timestamp formats and how events are recorded
   - Document any irregularities or special characters

## CSV Files Analyzed

- `2025.04.14 U17 Eesti - Gruusia (1pa).csv` - First half data
- `2025.04.14 U17 Eesti - Gruusia (2pa).csv` - Second half data

## Analysis Results

### Column Headers, Data Types, and Formats

| Column Name | Data Type | Format | Description |
|-------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Name | String | Text pattern | Combined event identifier with multiple attributes |
| Position | Integer | Milliseconds | Timestamp when event started |
| Duration | Integer | Milliseconds | Length of the event |
| Poolaeg | String | Number with period (e.g., "1.") | Half indicator |
| Põhimoment | String | 2-character code | Team possession indicator |
| Tsoon1 | String | 1-2 character code | Primary zone identifier |
| Tsoon2 | String | 1-2 character code | Secondary zone identifier |
| Tsoon3 | String | 1-2 character code | Tertiary zone identifier |
| Opening | String | Text code | Play initiation type |
| Pressing | String | Text code | Pressing intensity |
| Outcome | String | 3-character code | Success indicator (POS/NEG) |
| Result | String | Text code | Event outcome |
| Shot2 | String | Text code | Additional shot information |
| Standard last/4 | String | Text code | Set piece information |
| Field Position | String | Alphanumeric code | Location on field |

### Timestamp Formats and Event Recording

Events are tracked using two time-related columns:
1. **Position**: Represents the starting time of an event in milliseconds from the beginning of each half
2. **Duration**: Represents how long the event lasted in milliseconds

Time format peculiarities:
- Clock starts at 0 for each half
- Times are recorded in milliseconds (not in traditional match clock format)
- First half runs approximately 2,711,952 ms (~45 minutes)
- Second half runs approximately 2,783,152 ms (~46 minutes)
- No explicit stoppage time marking

### Event Recording Pattern:

Events are recorded sequentially with the following pattern:
1. An event begins (Position)
2. It continues for a certain duration (Duration)
3. Next event begins either immediately after or with some overlap

### Data Irregularities and Special Characters:

1. **BOM Character**: The first column header begins with a BOM (Byte Order Mark) character (invisible but present)

2. **Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - Some columns use Estonian terms (Poolaeg, Põhimoment)
   - Other columns use English terms or codes

3. **Empty Fields**: Several rows contain empty cells in certain columns, particularly:
   - Tsoon1, Tsoon2, Tsoon3 often left empty when not applicable
   - Shot2 mostly empty except for shooting events
   - Field Position sometimes missing

4. **Code System**: The data uses a complex coding system that requires interpretation:
   - Team codes: AA, DD, AD, DA
   - Zone codes: S1, S2, S3
   - Result codes: KEEPPOS, WINOPENSTAN, ENTRY, SHOTOFF, etc.

5. **Semicolon Delimiter**: The CSV uses semicolons (;) as delimiters rather than commas

## Code Descriptions

### Team Possession Codes (Põhimoment)
- **AA**: Estonia attacking
- **DD**: Georgia attacking
- **AD**: Transition from Estonia to Georgia
- **DA**: Transition from Georgia to Estonia

### Zone Codes
- **S1, S2, S3**: Different sectors of the pitch

### Opening Types
- **THROWIN_OPEN**: Throw-in
- **FK_OPEN**: Free kick
- **GK_OPENSHORT**: Short goal kick
- **STAN_CORNER**: Corner kick
- **STAN_KICKOFF**: Kickoff
- **STAN_FK**: Free kick

### Pressing Types
- **HIGHPRESS**: High intensity pressing
- **MIDPRESS**: Medium intensity pressing
- **LOWPRESS**: Low intensity pressing

### Outcomes
- **POS**: Positive outcome
- **NEG**: Negative outcome

### Results
- **KEEPPOS**: Maintained possession
- **WINOPENSTAN**: Won open standard
- **ENTRY**: Entry into attacking area
- **SHOTOFF**: Shot off target
- **SHOTGOAL**: Goal scored
- **SHOTBLOCK**: Shot blocked
- **SHOTON**: Shot on target

### Field Position Format
- Format: `[Side][Zone]/[Subzone]`
- Examples: M3, L2/1, R2/2
- Side indicators: L (Left), M (Middle), R (Right)
- Depth indicators: 1, 2, 3 (likely defensive to offensive)
- Sub-zones: /1, /2 (possibly inner/outer)

## Analysis Conclusions

This Dartfish CSV data provides a comprehensive event-by-event breakdown of the U17 football match between Estonia and Georgia. The data structure allows for detailed analysis of possession patterns, pressing intensity, shot outcomes, and spatial distribution of events.

The specialized coding system requires familiarity with the specific terminology and conventions used in the Dartfish tagging system for football analysis.
